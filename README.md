# Egocentric Data Pipeline

## Overview

This project represents a unique exploration into the world as perceived by common domestic animals such as dogs, cats, and others. By analyzing videos captured from cameras attached to these animals, the project aims to understand their perspective and behavior in various environments. Leveraging computer vision techniques, this research provides invaluable insights into animal-human interactions, spatial awareness, and general animal behavior.

## Features

- **Egocentric Perspective Analysis**: Exploration of videos from an animal's viewpoint to understand their interactions and behaviors.
- **Data Pre-processing**: Custom scripts to perform pre-processing on raw video footage, preparing it for further analysis.
- **Video Cleaning**: Algorithms to filter and clean the video data, eliminating noise and irrelevant information.
- **Data Extraction**: Extraction of essential data based on URLs and human-made annotations, enabling a focused analysis on key aspects.
- **Computer Vision Integration**: Utilization of state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to extract meaningful patterns and insights.

## Components

1. **Jupyter Notebooks**: A series of Jupyter notebooks have been created to guide through the different stages of analysis, from data pre-processing to visualization.

2. **Python Scripts**: Custom Python scripts designed for specific tasks such as pre-processing, cleaning, data extraction, and analysis.

### Jupyter Notebook Workflow

1. Cleaning Egocentric View of Animal Excel Spreedsheet.ipynb
2. Export Video URLs File Generation.ipynb
3. Analyze yt-dlp JSON ouputfiles.ipynb
4. Analysis of Frame Differences in Video Files.ipynb

### Python Files

- download_videos.py
- video_frame_analysis.py

## Installation

Detailed instructions on how to install and run the scripts are provided in the repository. Required dependencies and recommended environments are also listed.

## Usage

Users can run the Jupyter notebooks sequentially to visualize the process or directly use the Python scripts for specific tasks related to video analysis.

## Data 

The data consists of videos where cameras were attached to domestic animals, capturing their daily interactions and behaviors. Annotations provided by human observers further enrich the dataset.
